# Using the type definitions
To use the type definitions, simply import them to a TypeScript project by extracting it into the directory.
```typescript
/* You can import them as such */
import { Packages, Calls, Bullets /* etc. */ } from "./Mindustry";
```
If you do not know how to set up a TypeScript project, see "USING-TYPESCRIPT.MD"

Please note that as these type definitions are quite large, your editor of choice may take a while to have them loaded, and may error out for a while.
