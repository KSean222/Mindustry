# Using TypeScript for Mindustry modding

## Requirements
You will need to have Node.js installed, along with a suitable code editor of choice. VSCode is a recommended editor as it comes with TypeScript support out of the box.

## Procedure
Open up a terminal window.
### Windows
Press the Windows key + R. In the pop up box, type in "cmd" and hit "OK".
### Mac OSX
I don't actually use Mac OSX, and I have no idea whether it will actually work. I'm counting on a PR to bail me out.
### Linux
If you're on linux I assure you you already know how to do this.
```
npm install typescript -g
```
### TODO: Finish this
